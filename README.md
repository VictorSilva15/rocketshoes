## Requirements and How to use

If you want to access and study the code, follow the next steps:

To run this application locally you just need to install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) in your computer. By doing that npm (node package manager) will be installed too. So know you can start the application by running:

```bash
# Install yarn in computer globally
npm install yarn --global

# Install all dependencies with yarn
yarn

# Start the application with yarn
yarn start

```

To run the `Tests`

```bash

yarn test

```
